# Barnsley Skunkworks

Barnsley Skunkworks is a small and loosely structured group of people coming together monthly to research and develop innovative technology ideas, prototypes and solutions to issues identified in Barnsley, South Yorkshire.

For the moment it's run by the local council and limited to employees but once the honeymoon period passes and all the kinks are tweaked out of how the whole thing works, the intention is to open it up to the wider community.

While many look to Barnsley Council to address many of the issues faced in the town, the reality is that with ever reducing funding, the relationship between citizen and state has to change. Residents, businesses and visitors must do more for themselves. The council must use it's resources more effectively - it can't do as much as it once did anymore.

We recognise that technology, automation, artifical intelligence and the internet of things will play a huge part in achieving those efficiencies and so the skunkworks exists to allow employees from any council department to step away from the day job and apply their skills where they ordinarily wouldn't get the opportunity.
