                <p>Barnsley "Skunkworks" is the name given to a collaboration between the council, residents, local businesses and the maker community. We come together to discuss town issues and to create technology solutions for them using open-source approaches that can be reused by other towns and cities. We create prototypes that are later pitched against invest-to-save budgets to be taken forward in 'real-world' projects. We aim to solve problems for the council, make improvements for citizens and potentially spark new business opportunities for makers.</p>
