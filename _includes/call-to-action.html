                <p>Our "Skunkworks" are day-long sessions run on the last Thursday of each month. They take place as hack-day style events over 12 hours from 7am to 7pm. Teams are formed around identified issues and they then set about building technology prototypes that go someway to solving them. The days end with dragon dens style pitches to key stakeholders with a view to securing invest-to-save funding to take ideas forward into real-world solutions.</p>
