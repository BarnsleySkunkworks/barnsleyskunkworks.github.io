                While many look to the council to address the issues faced in the borough, the reality is that with ever reducing funding, the relationship between citizen and state has to change. Residents, businesses and visitors must do more for themselves. The council must use the resources it has more effectively - it simply can't do as much as it once did any longer.

                We recognise that technology, automation, artifical intelligence and the internet of things will play a huge part in achieving those efficiencies and so the skunkworks exists to allow employees from any council department to step away from the day job and apply their skills where they ordinarily wouldn't get the opportunity - to bring about radical change and innovation.
