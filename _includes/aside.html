              <h2>What is it doing?</h2>
              <p>We're building open-source solutions with software and hardware using anything you can lay your hands on to make up a working prototype, whether on your own or as part of a team. There are all kinds of ideas underway from enabling litter bins to report when they're full, to car parks publishing which of their spaces are empty, to anti-social behaviour hotspots reporting issues.</p>
              <p>If you can think it, and it can solve an issue in Barnsley, then it can be worked up into something real.</p>
